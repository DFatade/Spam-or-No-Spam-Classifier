# Spam-or-No-Spam-Classifier
I will be making use of Scikit learn to generate an algorithm capable of classifying whether or not an email is spam or not. 
I also played around with other models and some other data so that one can get an idea of what kind of analysis is 
made before a model is picked.

In the world of machine learning, it is really important that we are able to analyze what key data is useful for predictions.
I hope to help people understand that with this little project!
